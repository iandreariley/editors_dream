## Editor's Dream

### Summary:

This was a project for my data structures class. The assignment was to use a binary tree class that we had written in C++ as the base of a sorting and counting class that would take in an arbitrarily long text (we tested it on War and Peace) and count the occurances of each word, and display the top ten most frequent words, along with a summary of all other words and their counts if desired. I think this project showcase my abiility to write clear, concise code that is well structured, even when I had been coding for only a few months.
